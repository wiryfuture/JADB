The bot I decided to make for my discord server (and any other that may wish to use it).
To use, 
- download the files into a directory, and then using NodeJS/node install the packages it has in the ``package.json`` file. 
- insert your bot token in ``config.json``
- lastly, install ``nodemon`` globally and run it ,as simple as entering ``nodemon`` in the console, order to start the bot.

Inviting the bot requires you to generate an invite link, but an example invite link will be included here in the future so it is easier for you to start up.
