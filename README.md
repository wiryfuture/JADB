The bot I decided to make for my discord server (and any other that may wish to use it).
To use, 
- download the files into a directory, and then using NodeJS/node install the packages it has in the ``package.json`` file. 
- insert your bot token in ``config.json``
- lastly, install ``nodemon`` globally and run it ,as simple as entering ``nodemon`` in the console, order to start the bot.

To invite the bot, get it's client ID and replace the numbers in this link with it https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=123456789012345678&scope=bot.
